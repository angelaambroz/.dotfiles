# My dotfiles, nothing special

Right now I'm using:
- `zsh` with [`oh-my-zsh`](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) (+ plugins) and the [`pure`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) theme
- `gibo` for `.gitignore` boilerplate 
- A [Jupyter startup file](http://angelaambroz.com/blog/posts/2018/Apr/25/default_jupyter_startup/)
- Dan Pollock's [`hosts`](https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/) 

Nothin' crazy. [Here's my favorite Lucio Dalla song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFfhBX7ET-4)

Testing, testing.
