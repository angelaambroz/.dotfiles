"""
Goodreads API is dying, so I guess I'll have to scrape. :| 

Finding the most popular books in my social circle.
AKA: What are books where many of my friends have read/enjoyed?

Maybe:
    1. ETL data from Goodreads into a local db somewhere
    2. then do analytics against it (most popular, most read/least liked, etc)
